        <i>Science has again and again proved to be a vital part of our well-being.<br>
it is very crucial for science to be in our life.<br>
From our eating habits to our sleeping habits to bacteria. <br>science is everything and is everywhere.  the chair you are currently sitting on is made of atoms. The bed you were sleeping on last night, is also made of atoms.<br> Atoms are very small they can only be seen under a powerful microscope. The microscopic world is invisible to almost all of us.<br> some do not see it because of the equipment needed , some do not see because they think it is boring , some think it is too complex for them , but in the end many people have used science as their asset and changed the world. </i>
